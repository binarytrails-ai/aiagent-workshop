# LAB 1.2 : Function Calling in Semantic Kernel

Navigate to the `notebooks/semantic-kernel/function_calling.ipynb` notebook in your code repository to start this lab.

This lab will guide you through using Semantic Kernel to extend the capabilities of the model by providing it with tools that can be called during the conversation. Semantic Kernel internally manages the orchestration of these calls, including the necessary context and parameters.

**Objectives:**

- Understand how Semantic Kernel orchestrates function execution.
- Define and use inline semantic functions.
- Pass parameters to functions.
- Register and invoke C# plugin (native) functions.
