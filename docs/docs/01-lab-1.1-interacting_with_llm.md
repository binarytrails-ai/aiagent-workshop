# LAB 1.1 : Interacting with Large Language Models using Semantic Kernel

Navigate to the `notebooks/semantic-kernel/interacting_with_models.ipynb` notebook in your code repository to start the lab.

This lab will introduce you to Semantic Kernel and how to interact with different Large Language Models (LLMs) using it.

**Objectives:**

- Set up Semantic Kernel in C#.
- Connect to different LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Models).
- Use model parameters to customize responses.
- Use prompt templates with kernel arguments.
- Using system prompts to set the persona of the model.
