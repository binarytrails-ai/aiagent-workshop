# LAB 1.1 : Interacting with Large Language Models using Semantic Kernel

Navigate to the `notebooks/semantic-kernel/interacting_with_models.ipynb` notebook in your code repository to start the lab.

This lab will introduce how to interact with large language models (LLMs) using Microsoft Semantic Kernel in .NET.

**Objectives:**

- Understand how to set up Semantic Kernel for LLM interaction in .NET.
- Learn to configure and connect to different model providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub models).
- Use model parameters to customize model behavior.
- Send prompts to LLMs and receive responses.
- Use prompt templates and kernel arguments for dynamic, reusable prompts.
