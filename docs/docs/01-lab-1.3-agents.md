# LAB 1.3 : Building Agents with Semantic Kernel

Navigate to the `notebooks/semantic-kernel/agents.ipynb` notebook in your code repository to start this lab.

The lab will introduce you to building agents using Semantic Kernel. This is a basic introduction to AI Agents focussing on how to configure and invoke them. 

In the later labs, you will learn how to orchestrate multiple agents.

**Objectives:**

- Set up and configure agents in Semantic Kernel using `ChatCompletionAgent`.
- Add tools (plugins) to agents.

---

Agents in Semantic Kernel are powerful components that can use plugins (like a GitHub plugin) to answer questions, retrieve data, and provide real-time responses. The `ChatCompletionAgent` is a flexible agent type that can be configured with instructions, plugins, and arguments.
