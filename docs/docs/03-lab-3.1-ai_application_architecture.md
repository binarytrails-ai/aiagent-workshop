# Build a Simple Chat UI for Your AI Agent

In this lab, you will learn how to integrate an AI Agent into your own application.

The example app is built using a .NET backend API and a React-based chat UI. It walks through a basic scenario of a **Technical Support Agent** that can answer user questions to demonstrate the core concepts.

The goal is to provide a view of the end-to-end data flow between the frontend, backend, and Azure AI services.

## How It Works

![architecture.drawio](../media/architecture.drawio.png)

- The AI agent is set up in Azure AI Foundry. It can answer IT questions, help with support tickets, and more.
- The .NET backend API connects the chat website to the agent and handles the following requests:
    - Calls the AI agent to answer user prompts
    - Create Agent and chat threads
    - Get chat history for the thread
- The agent has tools (stubs) to do things like set up Office 365 accounts or fix network issues.
- The React frontend is a simple chat page. It sends your messages to the backend and shows the full chat history of the thread.

## Running the Application

1. The code for the backend and frontend is in the `src/` folder of the repository.

    Review the soure code to understand how the backend orchestrates the calls to the Agent.

    Refer to the file `src/Backend/Controllers/ChatController.cs` for the implementation logic of the API endpoints. 
    
    Understand how the backend interacts with the Azure AI Foundry Agent to create threads, send messages, and retrieve chat history.

    !!! warning
        Some API methods from the Semantic Kernel SDK are in preview and may change in future releases.

        Check the official docs for updates.

2. The Azure resources were already created in a previous lab (with `azd up`).
3. Run the following command. This will build the backend and frontend applications and deploy them to Azure App Service.

    ```bash
    azd deploy
    ```

    !!! note
        If you want to run the app locally, you can use `dotnet run` for the backend and `npm start` for the frontend. Make sure you have the required environment variables set up.

4. The backend and the frontend applications are hosted in Azure App Service.

    You can find the URLs in the Azure portal or in the `azd` output.

5. Open the website and start chatting with the agent.

## Code Challenges

Test your understanding and extend the solution with these challenges:

1. **Add a Knowledge Tool**  
    Enhance the agent by integrating a file search tool. This tool should allow the agent to read a file and answer user questions based on its content.

2. **Execute Tasks via OpenAI Spec**  
    Use the OpenAI Spec tool to execute tasks by calling external APIs. For example, expose an API that allows the agent to create a new support ticket in an external system.

3. **Create a New Agent Scenario**  
    Design and implement a new agent for a different use case (e.g. HR assistant, sales support).
