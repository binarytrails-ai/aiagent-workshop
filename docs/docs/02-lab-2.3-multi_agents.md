# LAB 2.3 : Multi-Agent Orchestration in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

Navigate to the `notebooks/ai-foundry/ai-foundry-multi-agent.ipynb` notebook in your code repository to start this lab.

An AI application often requires multiple agents to work together to achieve a common goal. This lab will guide you through the process of orchestrating multiple agents using Connected Agents in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.

In more complex scenarios, you can use `Semantic Kernel` which supports a variety of patterns for orchestration and communication between agents.

The lab builds on the previous labs where you learned how to create agents and use tools. In this lab, you will learn how to connect multiple agents together to work collaboratively.

**Objectives:**

- Understand the concept of multi-agent orchestration.
- Learn how to create and configure multiple agents in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service using Connected Agents.
