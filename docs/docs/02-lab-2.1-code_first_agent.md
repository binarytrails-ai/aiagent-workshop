# LAB 2.1 : Code First Agent in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

Navigate to the `notebooks/ai-foundry/ai-foundry-basic.ipynb` notebook in your code repository to start this lab.

This exercise is about creating a code-first agent in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service using Semantic Kernel.

You will create a customer service agent for Contoso, which will assist customers with inquiries about products, order status, returns, and general support.

----

## Using Azure AI Foundry Portal

After completing the lab using the notebook, you can also create an agent directly in the [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).

Follow the step-by-step instructions to create a new agent. Use the agent details (name, description, instructions) from the notebook as needed.

### Create a New Agent in Azure AI Foundry Portal

1. Navigate to [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure credentials.

2. **Create a New Agent**
      - Select your Azure AI Foundry project from the dashboard.
      - Click on the `Agents` tab in the left navigation pane. Then click on **+ New agent**.
      - Enter the agent details:
        - **Agent Name**: Use a meaningful name (e.g. `ContosoCustomerServiceAgent-Portal`).
        - **Description**: Provide a brief description of the agent's purpose.
            ```text
            This agent assists customers with inquiries about products, 
            order status, returns, and general support.
            ```
        - **Instructions**: Copy the system instructions below or use your own.
            ```text
            You are a helpful assistant for Contoso Bikes.
            Answer questions about company policies, especially the 
            return policy, using the provided documentation.
            If a question is not covered by the documentation, 
            politely inform the user.
            ```
        - **Model**: Select `gpt-4o` as the model for the agent.
        - **Knowledge**: Click **Add** and upload [contoso-bikes.pdf](https://github.com/binarytrails-ai/aiagent-workshop/blob/main/resources/contoso-bikes.pdf) file present in the resources folder of your code repository.

3. **Test your Agent** - Click **Try in Playground** to test your agent in the playground. 

      Try the following questions:

      ```text
      What is the return policy for Contoso Bikes?.
      ```

      ```text
      Can I change my order after it has been placed?
      ```

   When you interact with your agent a new thread is created in the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. Further interactions with the agent will continue in the same thread as a new run. You can view this by clicking on the `Thread Logs` tab in the agent details page.
