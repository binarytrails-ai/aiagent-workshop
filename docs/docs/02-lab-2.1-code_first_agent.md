## Steps to Create an Agent

1. **Create an Agent**
   - Navigate to the Azure AI Studio Portal.
   - Go to the **Agents** section and click on **Create Agent**.
   - <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the 'Create Agent' button -->

2. **Add Agent Name**
   - Enter a meaningful name for your agent (e.g., `ContosoCustomerServiceAgent`).
   - <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the agent name input -->

3. **Description**
   - Use the provided description above to clearly state the agent's purpose.
   - <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the description field -->

4. **Instructions**
   - Copy and paste the expanded system instructions above into the instructions field.
   - <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the instructions field -->

5. **Models**
   - Select the model(s) your agent will use (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5).
   - <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the model selection -->

6. **Go to the Playground**
   - After creating the agent, go to the **Playground** to interact with your agent.
   - <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the playground -->

7. **Ask a Prompt**
   - Type a prompt (e.g., "How can I return a product I purchased last week?") and observe the agentâ€™s response.
   - <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of a sample prompt and response -->

8. **What Happened?**
   - When you send a prompt, the following concepts are involved:
     - **Agent**: The AI entity you created, configured with instructions and models.
     - **Message**: Each user input or agent response is a message.
     - **Thread**: A conversation session that groups related messages together.
