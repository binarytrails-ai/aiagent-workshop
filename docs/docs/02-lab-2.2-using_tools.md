# LAB 2.2 : Using Tools in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service


In this lab, you will learn how to use tools in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. 

Tools help agents answer more questions and perform a wider range of tasks by connecting to different data sources or taking actions. You can decide which tools to add and how agents should use them by providing the right instructions.

There are two main types of tools:

- **Knowledge tools** let agents find information from sources like Azure AI Search, files, or the web.
- **Action tools** allow agents to perform actions, such as calling APIs or running functions.

To get started, you will work with two notebooks:

- `notebooks/ai-foundry/ai-foundry-knowledge-tools.ipynb`
- `notebooks/ai-foundry/ai-foundry-action-tools.ipynb`

Follow the steps in each notebook to complete the lab.

## Objectives

- Set up agents to use tools in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service
- Learn how to use a knowledge tool (file search) and an action tool (calling an API)
