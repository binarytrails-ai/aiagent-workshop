# üöÄ Get Started with GitHub Models

This guide will walk you through the setting up ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4o) on GitHub.

GitHub Models are **free to use**, meaning you can explore and build without worrying about costs. However, **rate limits** that apply, so you can only make a certain number of requests per minute. If you hit a limit, just wait a bit before trying again.

Check out the full details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/use-github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#rate-limits).

5. Want to chat with a model? Click **Playground** in the left menu after selecting a model.
6. Choose **OpenAI GPT-4.1** to start interacting.
7. Try asking something like:

   ```plaintext
    Can you explain the basics of quantum computing?
   ```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Grab Your API Key

We will be interacting with the models from our own applications, so we need an API key to authenticate our requests. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. On the top right corner of the **Playground**, click on the **Use this model** button.
1. Select **Get Developer Key**. This will take you to the page to create Personal Access Token (PAT).
1. Click on **Generate new token**.
1. Give your token a name, like `GitHub Models Access`.
1. Set the expiration to **No expiration** (or choose a suitable duration).
1. Under Permissions, navigate to Models and select  **Read-Only** access.
1. Copy the generated token and save it securely. You will need this token to authenticate your requests.
